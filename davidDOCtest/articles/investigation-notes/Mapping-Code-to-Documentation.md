In order for developers and tools to find the documentation that corresponds to a particular line of code, we need a way to link the two together.

[**SourceLinks 2**](http://www.wholetomato.com/sourcelinks/default.asp)
_for Visual Studio 2010-2015_

SourceLinks is a free Microsoft Visual Studio extension that turns source file comments into dynamic links to defect trackers, source control systems, documentation, and more.

Here are just some of the things you can do with SourceLinks:
* Jump to your bug tracker by double-clicking "bug NNNN" in a source comment
* See a tooltip describing a defect by hovering over "bug NNNN"
* Review a submission in your source control system by double-clicking "Change: NNNN"
* Read product documentation on your company's Intranet by double-clicking the words "DocID NNNN"

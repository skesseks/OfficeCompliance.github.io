## How to use this repository
This repository will be used to track investigations done for vNext. See below for where to put different types of content.

### Modifying Notes
I created a solution of type DocFX that is designed to allow you to edit documentation as code. Clone _InvestigationNotes_ to modify the notes. You must show all files to see the .md files, which are located under _Articles_.

You might have to install an extension or an add-in to make it work. 

### Sample WebAPI Project
The WebAPI project we created is also available to clone and play with. When you browse the built project it points you to all kinds of Web API information that may be very useful in understanding what it is we'd be trying to document.

In GitHub you can use "Tags" at check-in that I think are sort of like labels in SD. They're meant to represent releases or checkpoints in the code.
